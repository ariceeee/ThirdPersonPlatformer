# COSC416 Game Dev with Unity: Studio 3

## Assignment details

Make a 3rd person character controller from scratch.
Created by: Ariana Rice 24816522

## List of implemented features

1. Player can look around with 3rd person camera (used Cinemachine FreeLook Camera)
2. Environment consists of ground, invisible walls so player doesn't fall off edge, raised platforms, and coins
3. Player can move around using WASD keys
4. Player can jump using spacebar onto elevated platforms
5. Coins rotate and are collectable by the player
6. Score UI is updated when player collects (collides with) coin, and coin game object is destroyed

## Development notes

I really struggled trying to get the movement "feeling good". After doing the game design assignment to do with 
platformers I thought it wouldn't be too bad, but turns out it's harder than it looks! Gives me a new appreciation
for platformers and the amount of care that goes into them.
